## 🔍 Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates core C programming concepts through a practical console application. It's a strong example of:

- Function-based modularity
- Input validation and error handling
- Control flow with `switch` and `do-while` loops
- Safe and user-friendly interaction via the terminal

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** C
- **Tools:** GCC, VSCode
- **Concepts:** input validation, function design, arithmetic logic, conditionals

---

## 🚀 How to Run

### Compile

```bash
gcc -Wall -o calculator main.c
```

### Run

```bash
./calculator
```

> 💡 Tested on Linux and macOS. For Windows, use a compatible terminal and compiler like MinGW.
