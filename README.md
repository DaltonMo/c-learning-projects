## 🔍 Why This Project Matters

This repo demonstrates practical C programming skills valuable for systems-level development and technical interviews. Key takeaways include:

- Modular code structure and header file usage
- Input validation and safe user interaction
- Arithmetic logic and loop-based computation
- Working with conditionals, functions, and basic error handling

## 📦 Included Projects

### 1. [CLI Calculator](https://github.com/DaltonMo/c-learning-projects/tree/main/cli-calculator)

A command-line calculator that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with input validation and safeguards against divide-by-zero errors.

### 2. [Unit Converter](https://github.com/DaltonMo/c-learning-projects/tree/main/unit-converter)

A menu-driven converter for common measurement units like length and weight. Reinforces `switch` statements, loops, and formatted output.

### 3. **Fibonacci, Factorial, & Prime Checker (WIP)**

A number theory toolkit that calculates Fibonacci numbers, factorials, and determines primality using iterative logic.

## 🚀 How to Run

Each project has its own folder with a `README.md` and build instructions. To compile and run a project, navigate into its directory and use:

```bash
gcc -Wall -o program main.c
./program
```

Some projects may include additional `.c` or `.h` files for modular functionality. Check individual READMEs for specific build instructions.
